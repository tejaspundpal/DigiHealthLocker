# DigiHealthLocker

## Project Overview
DigiHealthLocker aims to revolutionize the healthcare experience by eliminating the need for patients to carry extensive health-related documents when visiting a doctor. This digital platform enables easy access to medical records from anywhere in India using an Aadhar card number and a registered phone with email access for verification. Designed for both doctors and patients, DigiHealthLocker ensures a seamless and efficient healthcare process.

## Features
#### For Doctors
#### Access Patient Records:
Doctors can access all medical records of a patient using the patient’s Aadhar card number.
#### Upload Medical Documents: 
Only doctors have the authority to upload medical documents to the patient’s profile on the portal.
#### Generate Appointments:
Doctors can create appointments for patients, which are linked to the patient’s Aadhar card.
#### Secure Verification: 
Access to patient documents is secured through an OTP sent to the patient's registered email for verification.

#### For Patients
#### View Medical Documents: 
Patients can log in and view all documents uploaded by their doctors.
#### View Appointments: 
Patients can see upcoming appointments that have been generated by their doctors.
#### Access Chatbot: 
Patients can interact with a chatbot to assist with medical-related queries and receive guidance.
#### Insurance Prediction: 
Patients can access insurance predictions tailored to their specific medical profile.

### Reminders Through Email
#### Appointment Reminders: 
Patients receive two email reminders for each appointment:    
>One day before the appointment date.                                
Five hours before the appointment time.
#### Verification OTPs: 
To maintain security, OTPs for document access are sent to the patient’s registered email.

## How It Works
#### 1. Patient Visits Doctor:
 The patient visits the doctor without needing to carry physical medical records.
####2. Aadhar Card Verification: 
The doctor accesses the patient's records using the Aadhar card number.
#### 3. Email OTP Verification: 
An OTP is sent to the patient’s registered email for document access verification.
#### 4. Document Upload: 
The doctor uploads any new medical documents to the patient's digital profile.
#### 5. Appointment Creation: 
The doctor schedules any follow-up appointments, and reminders are set automatically.
#### 6. Patient Access: 
The patient logs into the portal to view documents, appointments, and insurance predictions, and to interact with the chatbot for assistance with medical-related queries.
